Remaining hand/deck cards have some effect at end of day? - encourage balancing.


-- Solo ideas --

Interaction via central played cards pool. Maybe change price based on similar
cards played before? Encourage thinking of others and maintaining a diverse
deck! Played cards don't discard until someone takes a new day. Maybe could be
stolen or destroyed! huge avenue for interaction.

-- Partnered ideas --

OVERALL: Greatly improves interaction, greatly reduces "independent" feel.
Perhaps partnered 2x2?
Movement effects both partners, but uses bonuses from only 1 dog sled?
