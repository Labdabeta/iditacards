    \textsc{Each} coloured section of the board represents a stretch. Each
stretch has its own effect, listed next to it. Additionally there will be a blue
and red number next to each stretch. When you enter a stretch if you have less
starvation than the red number set your starvation to the red number. If you
have less hypothermia than the blue number set your hypothermia to the blue
number. This applies even if you enter the stretch moving backwards.

    \textsc{Start} of day effects on the board occur whenever any player takes a
new day, even if you do not partake in it.
