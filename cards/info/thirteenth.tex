    \textsc{To} play solo player first remove all utility (white) cards, then
deal yourself a starting deck (minus Rest). Flip the board to the solo side and
place a token before the starting line. The rules are the same, except the
track is much more difficult. Keep track of every new day you take using the
left-over dice and the slots on the board. The goal is to make it to the end in
as few days as possible without dying.
};

    \textsc{For} reference, the usual starting deck is: Breakfast x2, Lunch x2,
Dinner, Mush x2, Move x4, Grandma Soup, First Aid x2, Repair Sled x2, Upgrade
Sled x2, Rest, Lead Dog, Husky, Wheel Dog, Good Dog, A Hat, Armour, and Dog
Chow.
