    \textsc{To} begin the game separate out the upgrade cards from the starter
cards. The starter cards have a grey border and should be separated into 4 equal
decks (with the exact same cards in them).

    \textsc{Setup} the rest of the game by giving each player a starting deck, a red die,
a blue die, and a token. Their token should be placed before the starting line
on the map.

    \textsc{This} is a race. Your goal is to be the first to cross the finish
line. Just like the real iditarod, the race is 1600km long. Each square on the
board is one Mm, so there are 160 squares.
