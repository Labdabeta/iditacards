    \textsc{Starvation} increases the health cost of every card by 1 for each starvation
you have. Keep track of starvation using the red die.

    \textsc{Hypothermia} increases the energy cost of every card by 1 for each
hypothermia you have. Keep track of hypothermia using the blue die.

    \textsc{If} either your starvation or hypothermia reaches a level of 7 you
have died. Move back 30 myriameters and set them both to 0.

    \textsc{Neither} hypothermia nor starvation effect costs that are 0.
