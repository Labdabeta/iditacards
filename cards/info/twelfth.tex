    \textsc{Sled} cards are green. They have the text "Take X of Y". This means
you look at the top Y cards of the upgrade deck, choose X of them to place in
your discard pile, and destroy the rest.

    \textsc{Utility} cards are white. Do not use utility cards if you are
playing alone.

    \textsc{Movement} cards are blue. When you play a movement card add your
current speed to its effect.
