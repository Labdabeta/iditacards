    \textsc{Food} cards are yellow. As soon as you play a food card reduce your
starvation by 1. This happens before payment.

    \textsc{Personal} cards are purple. As soon as you play a personal card your
hypothermia is reduced by 1. This happens before payment. Personal cards have
the text "Destroy up to X of Y". This means you look at the top Y cards of your
deck, choose up to X of them to destroy, then choose which of the remaining
cards to shuffle back into your deck and which to draw into your hand.
