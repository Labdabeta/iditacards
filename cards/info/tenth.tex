    \textsc{The} remainder of this booklet describes the 7 types of cards.

    \textsc{Dog} cards are brown. When you play a dog it stays in front of you
and provides a passive bonus. You may only have up to 6 dogs at a time. You may
kill a friendly dog whenever you wish. Killed dogs are destroyed.

    \textsc{Attachment} cards are blue. You must play an attachment on a dog.
Dogs can only hold one attachment. You may not remove an attachment once played.
When the dog an attachment is on is killed, that attachment is discarded.
