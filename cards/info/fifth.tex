    \textsc{On} any turn the current player may choose to take a new day. Any
other players may choose to partake in the new day or not.

    \textsc{Participating} players abandon all current risks and shuffle all of
their cards into their deck. They then draw a new starting hand.

    \textsc{The} starting hand size is, by default, 6 cards. There is no upper
limit to hand size.
