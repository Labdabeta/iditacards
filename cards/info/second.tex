    \textsc{When} a card is played the three costs are resolved in order.

    \textsc{First}, the player must discard a number of cards equal to the "energy" cost
(blue number) of the card from their hand.  Second, the player must discard a
number of cards equal to the "health" cost (red number) of the card from the top
of their deck. If the player fails to pay either cost, the card does nothing.

    \textsc{Finally} the player must resolve the "risk" cost (black number) of
the card.
