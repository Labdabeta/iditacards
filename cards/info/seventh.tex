    \textsc{Recover} allows you to draw cards of your choice from your discard
pile. Recovered cards may also be shuffled into your deck.

    \textsc{When} you pass another player on the board you take 1 damage and they
are moved back 1 square. This process is iterative, so there can never be two
players on the same space of the board.

    \textsc{Immunity} does not apply to passing.
